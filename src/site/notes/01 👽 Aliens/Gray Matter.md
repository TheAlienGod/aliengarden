### Appearance

- Sleek, metallic-gray humanoid Galvan body with iridescent circuit-like patterns pulsing with bioluminescence
- Cybernetic Mechamorph Armor overlays capable of reshaping dynamically during combat
- Glowing blue eyes that reflect the merged consciousness of Azmuth and Albedo
- Hybrid Bio-Suit integrated with Omnitrix tech, adapting to any environment with stealth cloaking and phase shifting
- Omnitrix prominently displayed on forearm, visibly housing a swirling collection of alien DNA orbs, including exclusive Fourmangasor and Atomic X strains

---

### Origin & Lore

- Gray Matter is the zenith of Galvan evolution, a fusion of supreme intellect and alien hybrid DNA, designed to surpass the creator of the Omnitrix itself — Azmuth
- Formed through cosmic experiments involving the fusion of Azmuth’s genius and Albedo’s chaotic creativity, resulting in a being with dual souls, each influencing his personality and decision-making
- Crowned King of Galvan Prime after uniting fractured Galvan factions through both diplomacy and unrivaled technological dominance
- His Omnitrix is a unique hybrid, capable of not only transforming into classic aliens but also advanced hybrids and even synthetic beings from different Omnitrix variants
- Serves as the protector of the multiverse’s balance, wielding an arsenal that blends alien biology with cutting-edge Galvan tech and cosmic energy manipulation

### Weaknesses & Limitations

- Dual-soul complexity can cause mental overload during high-stress moments, risking brief incapacitation
- Highly dependent on power reserves; prolonged energy depletion reduces weapon and armor effectiveness
- Vulnerable to powerful EMPs or tech designed to disrupt molecular or quantum systems
- Political tensions on Galvan Prime create constant threats from rival factions and rebellious Null Void entities
- Hybrid alien DNA sometimes causes instability in transformation sequences if overused without proper calibration
