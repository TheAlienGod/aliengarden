# **Humungousaur: The Omnitrix King’s Divine Avatar**

**Species:** Vaxasaurian-Hanuman Hybrid  
**Home Planet:** Terradino (Vaxasaurian Origin) & Kapi-Lok Divine Realm (Hanuman’s Ancestral Plane)  
**Owner:** Shatadru Bose  
**Title:** King of Humungousaur, Supreme Avatar of Hanuman, Omnitrix’s Divine Guardian

---

### Appearance

- Towering reptilian behemoth standing over 30 meters tall, muscles rippling with raw cosmic energy.
- Skin forged from a rare cosmic alloy, a synthesis of Vaxasaurian dermis and Hanuman’s divine armor — **stronger than neutronium**, immune to any known damage.
- Complex glowing runic inscriptions running across his arms and torso in **ancient Sanskrit and alien glyphs**, pulsing with the energy of 4 divine souls housed in his brain.
- His head resembles a Tyrannosaurus rex but with a golden crown-like crest symbolizing divine kingship, with radiant eyes burning with the fire of devotion and destruction.
- In his divine forms (Panch Mukh and 11 Mukh), multiple faces manifest, each shimmering with different cosmic colors representing celestial beings.
- A massive **gadha (mace)** crafted from Omnitrix tech combined with Hanuman’s spiritual power is slung across his back — capable of shattering dimensions.
- Tail thick and armored, often glowing with fiery plasma during battle, creating hurricane-level winds with a single swing.
- Ethereal halos form behind his multiple heads during godly transformations, signifying his connection to the divine cosmos.

### Origin & Lore

- The fusion of **Vaxasaurian DNA**, an ancient dinosaur-like warrior race, and the immortal cosmic spirit of **Pavan Putra Mahabali Hanuman**, was an unprecedented experiment by the Omnitrix’s cosmic engineers combined with divine intervention.
- Shatadru Bose, through intense spiritual and technological mastery, unlocked the **Hanuman Stotra Protocol**, merging ancient Vedic mantras with advanced Omnitrix DNA recombination.
- The result was a new form of Humungousaur — not just a fighter, but a cosmic **avatar of faith, strength, and nuclear might**.
    
- Said to be **immortal in all 3 primary forms** (Normal, Panch Mukh, and 11 Mukh), his legend spans multiple galaxies and divine realms, revered by space monks and feared by tyrants.
    
- Tales tell that Humungousaur can call upon the powers of Hanuman’s many faces — each embodying a different celestial deity, giving him nearly infinite tactical versatility.
    
- As the **Omnitrix King**, Shatadru is the sole being who can command this avatar, harmonizing four distinct souls within it: the Hanuman spirit, the Celestial Mind (cosmic consciousness), the Doom Engine (raw destruction matrix), and the Volcanic Beast (primal elemental fury).
