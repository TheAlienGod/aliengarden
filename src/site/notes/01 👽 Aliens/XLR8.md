# XLR8: Omnitrix Godform – The Speedforce Sovereign

**Species:**  Omnitrix Hybrid Entity — Fusion of Speedforce Beings, Sonic Souls, and the Master Core of Shatadru Bose

**Home Planet:**  Omniverse Nexus (Located within the hyper-core of the Omnitrix; a dimension outside normal space-time)

**Owner:**  Shatadru Bose (Omnitrix King, Soul Anchor, and God of XLR8)

**Title:**  King of the Speedforce

---

### Appearance

- Tall, aerodynamic humanoid form with piercing blue and violet plasma lines coursing through the body.
- Eyes alternate between lightning white and glowing emerald depending on power mode.
- Back is flanked by seven rings of pure Speedforce and Sonic energy spinning like halos.
- Chest emblazoned with the Omega Omnitrix symbol, pulsing in sync with 33 soul resonances.
- Body flickers between states of matter — phasing in and out of tangibility when moving.
- Cape-like blur effect trails constantly from the legs, made of raw Speedforce residue.

---

### Origin & Lore

- Created during the cosmic merging of Flash's multiversal Speedforce and Sonic's Chaosverse, the Omnitrix synthesized all known speed entities into a singular evolutionary form.
- The Godform was stabilized by embedding Shatadru Bose’s soul as the controlling nucleus.
- Legends speak of this entity being the Guardian of the Chrono-Velocity Fabric, defending all timelines from collapse.
- The 33 souls within (15 from Flash forms, 17 from Sonic forms, and 1 Omnigod Soul) act as advisors and power sources.
- Feared by cosmic time lords and revered by interdimensional speed deities.
- Recognized by all Speedforce entities as the rightful **King of the Speedforce**.

- Lasts indefinitely if user remains conscious and mentally unified with all souls.

- Capable of intense rage in Black Flash or Dark Sonic states, but always returns to cosmic balance.
- Shows childlike joy in racing across galaxies, but calculates on the level of omniversal tacticians.
