# **Omni-Chromastone Shatadron**

**Species:**  Anodyte-Petrosapien-Mage Hybrid (Triune Soul Entity of Shatadru, Gwen, and Verdona)

**Home Planet:**  Petropia (Physical Anchor) , Ledgerdomain (Mana Nexus Realm)

**Owner:**  Shatadru Bose (Omnitrix King)

**Title:** 

---

### Appearance

- Humanoid crystalline body made of a transparent, ultra-dense Petrosapien crystal structure infused with **pulsing mana veins**.
- Body constantly radiates **auras of shifting colors**: violet, cyan, magenta, golden white—each color represents a different school of mana.
- **Omnitrix Core** embedded in the chest, surrounded by runic circuits; a **second dial** (Gwen 10’s Omnitrix) fused on the left forearm with magic-reactive symbols.
- Hair (if visualized) is made of pure, flowing Anodite plasma energy.
- **Six charms of Bezel** orbit his wrists and shoulders like protective satellites. The **Keystone of Bezel** glows behind his back like a cosmic halo.
- **Guardian Crystal** is lodged in the forehead—beating like a heart, glowing brighter when accessing planetary-level power.

---

### Origin & Lore

- Created when Shatadru Bose synchronized his consciousness with Gwen Tennyson and Verdona, during a **Ledgerdomain collapse event** that nearly destroyed all magical timelines.
- Gwen’s Omnitrix, exposed to raw mana from the Astral Sea, fused into Chromastone’s crystalline core, creating a **mana-conductive sentient alloy**.
- Empowered by the **Guardian Crystal**—the neural and spiritual anchor of Petropia—and chosen by the Bezel Charms to be their eternal wielder.
- Omni-Chromastone Shatadron is not just a transformation—he is a **living convergence** of mana, crystalline energy, and universal balance.

### Weaknesses & Limitations

- **Overexertion Risk** – Using too many charms or cosmic spells at once may cause temporary fusion instability.

- **Guardian Crystal Crack** – If shattered, will cause a **planetary-level mana implosion**.
