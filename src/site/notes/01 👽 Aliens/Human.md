## 📖 Origin & Lore

In the time of cosmic fracture, the Omnitrix didn’t seek just strength—it searched for **balance**. In Shatadru Bose, it found the **perfect nexus**: part human, part god, part genius, part protector.

Through **The Great Soul Alignment**, 24 legendary souls voluntarily merged into one being to create **Shatadru Prime**, capable of guiding the Multiverse into harmony.

This is not just a warrior—this is the **living embodiment of ideal humanity**.
