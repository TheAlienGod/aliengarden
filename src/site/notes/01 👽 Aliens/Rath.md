**Home Planet:** Appoplexia Prime / Divine Realm Nexus  
**Owner:** Shatadru Bose (The Omnitrix King)

---

### Appearance

- Towering at 12 feet tall, Rath‚Äôs Tri-Soul form is covered in obsidian-gold bio-armor with divine runes glowing across his limbs.
    
- His claws shimmer with a silver-red energy, shifting between physical and ethereal forms.
    
- Three glowing eyes (one in the center of his forehead) represent his three souls.

### Origin & Lore

- Rath was reborn in the Omnitrix during a multiversal rupture when Shatadru‚Äôs DNA accidentally merged with **Wolverine‚Äôs primal instincts** and the **divine avatar energy of Narasimha**.
    
- The result? A singularity-level entity designed to maintain **karmic balance**, **absolute defense**, and **offensive devastation**.
    
- Rath doesn't just fight ‚Äî he judges. The battlefield is his courtroom, the enemy is the defendant, and his claws are the sentence.

### Powers & Abilities

#### Core Abilities

##### **Enhanced Strength (Class: Multiversal+)**
