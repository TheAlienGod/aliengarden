# Four Arms: Ultimate Colossus

**Species:** Tetramand-Hybrid Cosmic Entity  
**Home Planet:** Khoros (Gamma Nexus Crucible)  
**Owner:** Shatadru Bose (Owner, God & Soul King)

**Title:** 

---

### Appearance

- A towering figure standing over 15 feet tall, with four massive muscular arms covered in shifting skin hues: from Hulk’s iconic greens and grays to deep reds, blues, and cosmic purples that glow faintly in the dark.
- His form constantly subtly shifts and morphs, reflecting the essence of the 45 Hulk forms and 3 Saitama modes contained within him. Sometimes his skin hardens like armor, sometimes it ripples with energy waves.
- His eyes are kaleidoscopes of power, sometimes burning emerald, other times calm gray or blazing fiery red — each representing a Hulk or Saitama persona dominating at the moment.
- His voice carries multiple tones — a layered resonance of all the souls inside, sometimes growling rage, sometimes calm reasoning, sometimes deadpan seriousness.
- Wears remnants of alien armor fused into his body, including fragments of the Omnitrix King’s crown and cosmic sigils glowing faintly on his chest and shoulders.
- An aura of overwhelming gamma radiation and pure energy pulses visibly, fluctuating with his mood and power level, lighting up the surrounding space with shimmering waves of power.

### Origin & Lore

- Forged in the crucible of the **Gamma Nexus**, a mysterious cosmic event where multiple realities and timelines converge. This event shattered space-time barriers, allowing fusion of powerful entities across universes.
- Shatadru Bose, the Omnitrix King and supreme cosmic architect, crafted Four Arms by binding together the essences of 45 distinct Hulk forms, 3 Saitama modes, and himself — resulting in a singular warrior with 49 distinct souls residing within his mind.
- Each soul retains its memories, personality, and power, creating an internal council in his mind where they debate, strategize, and sometimes clash. This mental multiplicity grants Four Arms unparalleled versatility but also a constant internal struggle.
- Created as the multiverse’s ultimate protector, tasked with defending the balance between chaos and order by Shatadru Bose himself — a living weapon and guardian.
- Known across countless galaxies as **"The Infinite Colossus," "Breaker of Worlds,"** and **"The Gamma God.”** His legend is told in whispers and fears by cosmic civilizations.

### Powers & Abilities

#### Core Abilities

- **Infinite Strength:**  
    The physical strength of Four Arms is literally limitless, scaling exponentially with anger and determination. This strength comes from every Hulk form combined — from Savage Hulk’s raw brute force to World War Hulk’s cataclysmic planet-shattering punches, up to Heart of the Monster Hulk’s cosmic-level might. Each arm can independently deliver devastating blows strong enough to pulverize celestial bodies.
- **Superhuman Durability:**  
    His skin, muscle, and bones are virtually indestructible. Derived from Immortal Hulk’s near-invincibility, Red Hulk’s heat resistance, and Armor Hulk’s armored hide, Four Arms can shrug off nuclear blasts, supernova explosions, and energy beams with little to no damage.
- **Regeneration & Healing Factor:**  
    Damage is repaired instantly at a cellular level, thanks to the combined regenerative properties of Immortal Hulk, Hulk the End, and Maestro. Even if reduced to near ashes or molecular fragments, Four Arms’s body reforms rapidly.
- **Infinite Stamina & Endurance:**  
    No matter how long or intense the battle, Four Arms never tires. Drawing on Joe Fixit’s relentless street fighter endurance, Blue Hulk’s stamina, and Saitama’s endless energy reserves, fatigue is a concept that doesn’t exist for him.
- **Four Arms:**  
    Having four powerful, fully functional arms means he can fight with unmatched multitasking capability—blocking, striking, grappling, and defending simultaneously. Each arm channels different Hulk powers or Saitama techniques depending on the battle needs.

#### **Mental & Cognitive Abilities**
- **Multiple Souls Council:**  
    The 49 souls (45 Hulk forms, 3 Saitama modes, and Shatadru Bose’s own essence) reside in an internal mental council. This grants Four Arms:
    - Vast tactical and combat knowledge.
    - Instant access to memories and combat experience across countless battles and universes.
    - Superior problem-solving abilities combining Professor Hulk’s intellect with Saitama’s fight intuition.
- **Telepathic & Psychic Resistance:**  
    Thanks to Mindless Hulk, Devil Hulk, and Shatadru’s cosmic mind, Four Arms is highly resistant to psychic and telepathic intrusion. His fractured mind and multiple personas confuse or repel mind attacks.
- **Emotional Control:**  
    The internal council helps regulate emotions. Though anger boosts power, Professor Hulk and Shatadru keep Four Arms from losing control to berserker rage, maintaining focus during battles.
- **Cosmic Awareness & Precognition:**  
    With Post-Time Travel Saitama’s temporal perception and Captain Universe Hulk’s cosmic senses, Four Arms can sense cosmic shifts, predict enemy moves seconds to minutes in advance, and detect interdimensional threats.

#### **Energy Manipulation**

- **Gamma Radiation Mastery:**  
    Four Arms can generate, absorb, and project massive amounts of gamma radiation, a signature of the Hulk forms. This can be used offensively (gamma blasts, radiation storms) or defensively (gamma shields).
- **Cosmic Energy Control:**  
    From Captain Universe Hulk and Omnitrix King powers, Four Arms channels cosmic energy flows, enabling:
    - Energy beams and waves of incomprehensible destructive power.
    - Energy absorption to heal or boost his powers.
    - Energy manipulation to alter gravity, create force fields, or disrupt energy attacks.
- **Time & Space Manipulation (Limited):**  
    Post-Time Travel Saitama and Omnitrix King enable Four Arms to:
    - Create localized time dilation fields (slowing or speeding time).
    - Teleport short to medium distances across dimensions or time.
    - Momentarily phase through objects or avoid attacks by bending space-time.

---

#### **Transformation & Power Switching**

- **Instant Form Switching:**  
    Four Arms can instantly shift between Hulk forms or Saitama modes as battle demands. For example:
    - From Savage Hulk for brute force.
    - To Professor Hulk for strategy and intelligence.
    - To Serious Mode Saitama for precise, unstoppable strikes.
    - To Immortal Hulk for regeneration and near-immortality.
    - To Post-Time Travel Saitama for cosmic awareness and temporal manipulation.
- **Hybrid Form Combos:**  
    He can merge traits from multiple forms simultaneously—like combining Blue Hulk’s durability with Saitama’s Serious Mode speed for a devastating combo.
- **Anger-Driven Power Surge:**  
    Power levels rise exponentially with anger, rage, or emotional intensity, triggering primal forms such as World War Hulk or Devil Hulk for ultimate destructive power.

---

#### **Combat & Tactical Abilities**

- **Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant:**  
    Combines Saitama’s flawless fighting technique and reflexes with Hulk’s ferocity and unpredictability. Four Arms can fight multiple enemies at once, block attacks while delivering devastating counterattacks with unmatched speed and precision.
- **Weapon Proficiency:**  
    Skilled in using cosmic weapons and artifacts like the Infinity Fist Gauntlet and Timebreaker Amulet, channeling their powers through his four arms.
- **Adaptive Fighting Style:**  
    Drawing from each Hulk’s unique fighting style (brute force, street fighting, tactical, berserk) plus Saitama’s unbeatable combo of speed, power, and precision, Four Arms adapts fluidly to any opponent.

#### **Unique Soul-Powered Abilities**

- **Shatadru Bose’s Omnitrix King Influence:**  
    Grants supreme control over the fusion of all souls, preventing mental chaos and harmonizing power surges. Also bestows cosmic authority over multiversal balance.
- **Maestro’s Ruthlessness:**  
    When necessary, Four Arms can tap into ruthless, battle-hardened aggression for overwhelming offense without mercy.
- **Devil Hulk’s Dark Power:**  
    Accesses darker gamma energies for fear manipulation and tapping into shadow dimensions.
- **Saitama’s Post-Time Travel Mode:**  
    Grants cosmic-level power beyond conventional limits and temporal manipulation ability, making him nearly unbeatable in battle.
- **Hulkpool & Venom Hulk Abilities:**  
    Includes symbiote-enhanced combat, shape-shifting limbs, and parasitic regeneration.

#### **Regeneration & Immortality**

- **Immortal Hulk Core:**  
    Even if Four Arms’ physical body is destroyed, the Immortal Hulk soul triggers resurrection from gamma energy and cosmic essence.
- **Hulk the End & Titan Hulk Resilience:**  
    Extreme durability to survive apocalyptic or universe-ending events, capable of sustaining eternal life.
- **Heart of the Monster Hulk’s Cosmic Vitality:**  
    Gives access to infinite life force energy, preventing natural death.

### Weaknesses & Limitations

- **Mental Fragmentation Risk:** The 49 souls constantly debate and sometimes conflict internally. Excessive stress or psychic assault can cause temporary mental fragmentation, weakening his combat efficiency.
- **Emotional Balance Crucial:** Anger fuels his power, but losing control leads to berserk states where judgment is impaired, risking collateral damage or vulnerability.
- **Transformation Vulnerability:** Brief but intense vulnerability windows occur when shifting between Hulk forms and Saitama modes, especially when switching to Post-Time Travel or Omnitrix modes.
- **Psychic Attacks:** Though highly resistant, psychic or spiritual assaults targeting his mind’s multiplicity can disrupt his cohesion.
- **Omnitrix Dependency:** The crown and sigils linked to Omnitrix King’s power are a source of cosmic stability; severing this link drastically reduces his power and control.
