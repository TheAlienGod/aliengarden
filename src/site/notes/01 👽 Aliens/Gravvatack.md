# Gravattack Supreme: **Lord of Infinite Gravity**

**Species:** Gravitarian Core Entity (Celestial Gravattack Overdeity Variant)  
**Home Planet:** Gravitas Sigma-0 (a hyper-collapsed singularity at the end of time)  
**Owner:** Shatadru Bose  
**Title:** Supreme Warden of Omniversal Gravity

---

### Appearance

- **Height:** Variable; base form is planet-sized but can shrink to humanoid size for compression states.
    
- **Body Composition:** Forged from _quantum-compressed gravitonium_, a substance denser than the laws of physics allow.
    
- His **core** beats visibly through his chest—a _supermassive blackhole glowing like a red dwarf_, surrounded by orbiting micro singularities.
    
- **Gravishield rings** float behind him like seraphic halos, orbiting his body in calculated gravitational paths.
    
- His **armor**, dark and interstellar, refracts reality—every panel displays warped versions of nearby galaxies.
    
- In full battle mode, his silhouette becomes a gravitational eclipse, blotting out stars within lightyears.
    

---

### Origin & Lore

- Gravattack Supreme was created in a **cosmic rebirth event** at the final collision of two dying omniverses.
    
- His **gravitational heart** was formed from the remnants of 20 of the most powerful blackholes ever recorded, orbiting a **gravitational deity-core** called the **Gravastar Prime**.
    
- Each of these blackholes maintains its orbit in eternal motion within his core, contributing to the **10,000x universal gravity baseline**.
    
- **Shatadru Bose**, God of Omnitrix Entities, discovered Gravattack Supreme while restoring the Omnitrix's lost god-tier forms.
    
- When chosen by Shatadru, Gravattack Supreme awakened fully, unlocking the ability to collapse, create, and rewrite universes based on gravitic law.

### Powers & Abilities

#### Core Gravitational Powers

- **Blackhole Core Engine**  
    The heart of Gravattack Supreme is a supermassive quantum blackhole encased in gravitonium, housing 20 orbiting mini-singularities that fuel his infinite gravitational energy output. It can collapse, expand, and manipulate gravity on all scales, from subatomic to omniversal.
    
- **Omniversal Gravity Rewrite**  
    Directly reprogram gravity laws across timelines, universes, and omniverses. This power lets him _create new gravitational constants_, nullify gravity zones, or reverse gravity flows at will.
    
- **Gravitational Compression Field**  
    Compresses any form of matter or energy into near-infinite density points — blackholes, neutron stars, or quantum singularities on demand. Can instantly turn entire planets into micro-singularities.
    
- **Absolute Gravity Anchor**  
    Gravattack Supreme is anchored to existence’s core gravitational blueprint, making him immune to teleportation, displacement, erasure, or phase-shifting effects.
    
- **Graviton Quantum AI**  
    Calculates gravitational interactions across infinite realities faster than light speed, allowing preemptive reaction to all gravitational shifts.
    
- **Gravity Wave Manipulation**  
    Sends, absorbs, or cancels gravitational waves across the fabric of space-time, capable of disrupting planetary tectonics, star fusion, and even consciousness in grav-dependent lifeforms.
    

---

#### Matter & Energy Control

- **Matter-Antimatter Gravitic Weaving**  
    Can weave gravitational fields that force matter to annihilate with antimatter or prevent such reactions, effectively controlling matter stability on an atomic and subatomic level.
    
- **Graviton Field Shielding (Gravishield)**  
    Generates an omnidirectional shield made of layered gravitational runes that can absorb, redirect, or collapse incoming energy and physical attacks—even those from omnipotent sources.
    
- **Energy Absorption & Redirection**  
    Absorbs kinetic, thermal, nuclear, psychic, and cosmic energy and converts it into gravitational force or emits it back as concentrated graviton pulses.
    
- **Light Compression & Nullification**  
    Uses gravitational lenses to bend and compress light around himself, rendering him invisible or blinding opponents with sudden gravitational light refraction bursts.
    

---

#### Time & Spacetime Mastery

- **Time Shear Manipulation**  
    Alters local time flow by modifying gravity-induced time dilation effects—speeding up or slowing down time within selected zones, including rewinding or freezing moments in battle.
    
- **Spacetime Folding & Warping**  
    Can fold space like paper, creating wormholes, shortcuts, or trapping foes in spacetime loops and gravitational eddies.
    
- **Dimensional Phase Shifting**  
    Temporarily phases out of current dimensional space by shifting gravity resonance frequency, allowing intangibility or travel between alternate realities.
    
- **Gravity-Induced Temporal Stasis**  
    Locks targets in temporal stasis bubbles by suspending their local gravity fields, freezing them in time while Gravattack Supreme acts freely.
    

---

#### Offensive & Defensive Abilities

- **Gravitational Singularity Pulse**  
    Releases a powerful area-of-effect implosion that pulls matter and energy inward toward a rapidly growing singularity, crushing enemies and terrain alike.
    
- **Event Core Implosion**  
    Initiates a localized blackhole collapse at his core, generating a vacuum that erases physical existence in its immediate vicinity.
    
- **Zero Flux Dome**  
    Creates a dome of inverted gravity that immobilizes and crushes enemies within by negating all motion and kinetic energy.
    
- **Black Spiral Detonation**  
    Fires a twisting vortex of graviton energy that spirals through enemy formations, distorting space and compressing matter into recursive black holes.
    
- **Orbital Godlash**  
    Swings his gravishield rings as chain-linked weapons, ripping through matter and bending space around them to disrupt reality’s fabric on contact.
    
- **Supermass Collapse Beam**  
    Projects a focused beam from the Gravastar Prime core, capable of turning stars into dust and collapsing celestial bodies with one blast.
    
- **Anchor Vortex Trap**  
    Uses the Omnitrix Anchor Crystal to generate quantum gravity orbits that trap and recycle enemy powers in endless return loops.
