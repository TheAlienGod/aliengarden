# Feedback (Omnitrix Ultimate Form)

---

**Species:**  
Hybrid Alien - Fusion of multiple Omnitrix species and DNA (Heatblast, Four Arms, XLR8, Goop, Wildmutt, etc.)

**Home Planet:**  
Multiple origins (Terra, Petropia, Khoros, Anur Transyl, and more—reflecting combined DNA)

**Owner:**  
Shatadru Bose

**Title:**  
The Energy And Osmosis King

---

### Appearance

Armored titan encased in a composite shell of steel, diamond, gold, osmium, and alien Petrosapian DNA.  
A sleek, imposing figure glowing with energy bursts from various alien power signatures.  
Visually a fusion of classic Feedback with hints of each power’s distinct traits — fiery Heatblast flames, crystalline Diamondhead facets, and kinetic XLR8 speed trails.

---

### Origin & Lore

Born from the fusion of the Omnitrix and the Antitrix combined with the souls of Shatadru Bose, Kevin Levin, Gwen, and Aggregor — Feedback transcended standard limitations to become an unstoppable force of alien power and human will.  
Forged through battles, wisdom, and countless transformations, Feedback was designed to be the ultimate guardian of balance across dimensions.

### Powers & Abilities

**Core Abilities:**
- **Omni-Energy Control**: Absorbs, redirects, and converts all known forms of energy—electric, nuclear, elemental, magical, and even cosmic—thanks to Feedback, Chromastone, and Alien X DNA.
	- After absorbing enough energy, can overload surroundings, tech, or even enemies by pumping unstable energy back — causing chain reactions, system meltdowns, or explosions.

- **Time Manipulation**: Freeze, loop, fast-forward, or erase time; create alternate timelines or restore erased realities.
- **Space Manipulation**: Fold, stretch, teleport, or collapse space itself.
- **Immortality**: Cannot age or die due to Alien X’s immortal structure and Snare-Oh’s undead physiology.

### Weaknesses & Limitations

- **Internal Soul Conflicts:** The four souls sometimes clash in will or strategy, causing hesitation or emotional overload during critical moments.
- **Susceptibility to Power Suppression:** Magic or alien tech that suppresses Omnitrix functions or nullifies energy powers can temporarily neutralize Feedback.

---

### Known Allies & Enemies

**Souls:**
- Shatadru Bose (Owner & God)
- Kevin Levin
- Gwen
- Aggregor

**Enemies:**
- Vilgax and his intergalactic forces
- Rogue cosmic warlords and antimatter entities
- Dark technopaths aiming to hack or corrupt the Omnitrix system

---

### Notable Battles & Events

- Defended Earth from a combined invasion by Vilgax and Aggregor’s forces, showcasing flawless teamwork between the souls.
- Prevented a dimensional collapse by channeling Full Alien X’s near-infinite reality warping at the cost of temporary power exhaustion.

### Connected Powers & Artifacts

- **The Omnitrix & Antitrix:** Dual alien devices powering Feedback, enabling unprecedented transformations and fail-safes.
	- **Dual-Core System**: Feedback has both Omnitrix and Antitrix DNA structures, enabling access to both heroic and rogue alien mutations. This provides:
		- **Hybridized Mutant Forms** (e.g., a Stinkfly-Wildvine combo or a Goop-Diamondhead fusion).
		- **Brute Buffs** from Kevin-style evolutions (thick armor, fusion of abilities, higher aggression factors).
		- **Energy Infection Burst**: Can infect enemy tech or organisms with unstable mutant energy to disable or mutate them temporarily.
		- **Power Override**: Can override standard alien limitations—for instance, giving Wildmutt the ability to speak or XLR8 the ability to fly.
	- **Aliens**:
		- **Quad Smack** (like Four Arms)
		- **Hot Shot** (like Heatblast)
		- **Rush** (like XLR8)
		- **Skunkmoth** (like Stinkfly)
		- **Dark Matter** (like Grey Matter)
		- **Wreckingbolt** (like Cannonbolt)
		- **Bashmouth** (original werewolf alien)
		- **Thornblade** (plant-based alien)
		- **Bootleg** (Upgrade-like alien)
		- **Humungoraptor** (mix of Humungousaur and Rath)
- **Armor Composition:**
    - **Steel**: Base structure; provides reliable, durable skeletal reinforcement.
	- **Diamond**: Ultra-hard plating—resistant to most forms of piercing, slashing, and kinetic attacks.
	- **Petrosapian DNA**: Allows dynamic crystal growth for regeneration, weapon formation, and environmental manipulation.
	- **Taydenite**: Enhances energy absorption tenfold; makes the armor a power amplifier for energy attacks.
	- **Gold**: Conductive layer integrated with Feedback’s electricity manipulation to store and channel high-voltage plasma.
	- **Osmium**: Densest natural metal—provides planetary-core level durability while being nearly indestructible.
	- _Functions:_
		- **Adaptive Response Core**: Armor shifts and reshapes to threats (like Upgrade), creating spikes, blades, or shields based on environmental feedback.
		- **Plasma Channeling Veins**: Stores absorbed energy from attacks and routes it into explosive counters or supercharged punches.
		- **Quantum Stabilizers**: Prevents reality distortion when using Alien X powers by anchoring Feedback to a stable dimensional frequency.
		- **Thermal Balancing Mesh**: Grants immunity to any temperature changes—from absolute zero (Big Chill) to solar core heat (Heatblast, Swampfire).
		- **Gravity Null Field**: Built-in Gravattack module allows for controlled gravity bubbles, flight, or immobilization of enemies.
- **Kevin 11000 Tech Module:** Advanced weaponry and shield systems integrated into the armor and Omnitrix interface.
- **Four-Soul Consciousness Matrix:**
Stored within Feedback’s mental matrix:
	- **Shatadru Bose**: The original mind and moral compass. God-tier strategist and wielder of creativity beyond the known Omniverse.
	- **Kevin Levin**: Offers brute force mindset, aggression, and intuitive tech manipulation.
	- **Gwen Tennyson**: Grants magical insight, mana-based energy control, and spatial awareness.
	- **Aggregor**: Taps into ruthless planning, power absorption techniques, and alien hunting instincts
	_Effect:_ These four consciousnesses can communicate, debate, and collaborate internally like an internal council (similar to Alien X’s Bellicus and Serena). Shatadru maintains control but can channel the skills or instincts of the others at will.

### Transformation Details

- Seamless and instant transformation into any of 40+ alien forms, each optimized by armor layers and soul synchronization.
- Armor phases between different materials depending on the active power mode (e.g., diamond crystallizes during defense, osmium layers thicken during heavy attacks).
- Antitrix triggers automatically during critical failures, switching Feedback into “Emergency Mode” with heightened defense and counterattack protocols.
- Multisoul interface allows tactical advice, power balancing, and emotional regulation during combat.

---

### Personality & Behavior

- Strategic and highly analytical due to the combined intellect of the four souls.
- Protective and loyal to Shatadru Bose and allies, willing to sacrifice for the greater good.
- Displays moments of humor and warmth from Gwen’s influence, balancing Kevin’s toughness and Aggregor’s raw intensity.
- Capable of rapid adaptation, learning from battle experiences in real time.
