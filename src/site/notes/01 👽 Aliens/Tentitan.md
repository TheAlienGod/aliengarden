**Title:** 

---

### **Appearance**

- Towering 100 ft. titan in war-mode, 12 ft. humanoid form for mobility
- Capable of changing size from 12 ft to planetary scale
- Armor: Adaptive quantum-alloy skin laced with red-black Malware veins
- Chest: Radiant core pulsing with green Omnitrix sigils, surrounded by Diagon glyphs
- Shoulders: Engraved Ascalon plating shaped like broken wings
- Tentacles: Reconfigurable, extending up to 5 km, tipped with antimatter claws
- Halo: Dimensional halo floating above head when fully powered
- Voice: Bass-heavy, multi-layered speech with Alien X echo distortion

---

### **Origin & Lore**

- **Tentitan Ascendant** is the result of an impossible fusion event during the **Multiversal Collapse**, when Ben, Vilgax, Malware, and Diagon clashed in the **Chrono-Singularity**
- **Alien V**, a forbidden fusion of Alien X and Vilgax, was stored deep inside the Omnitrix Core
- Shatadru activated the **Tentitan Protocol** using the Nexus Core and **reprogrammed the genetic firewall**, stabilizing the 20% Alien X fragment
- This fusion defies reality: built on a foundation of conquest, mutation, divine essence, and raw Chrono-energy
