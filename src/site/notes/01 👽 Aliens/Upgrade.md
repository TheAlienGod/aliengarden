**Home Planet:** Galvan Prime

**Owner:**  Shatadru Bose (Owner & God)  

**Title:** The Techno-Evolver

---

### Appearance

- Upgrade stands roughly 7 feet tall, with a lithe yet imposing frame that perfectly balances organic fluidity and mechanical precision. Its entire body is a seamless fusion of sleek, dark metallic alloys and biomechanical tissue, engineered for both durability and flexibility. The surface gleams with a polished obsidian black finish, interlaced with silver and chrome plating that outlines its musculature like armor plates on a futuristic warrior.

- The joints and limbs are segmented with intricate articulation points, allowing for fluid, almost liquid-like movement despite its rigid components. Thin bands of pulsating neon blue light snake along the contours of its arms, legs, and torso—these aren’t just aesthetic; they represent the energy channels circulating through its cybernetic nervous system. These glowing circuits occasionally flicker rhythmically, mirroring its processing activity or emotional states.

- Upgrade’s head is angular and streamlined, shaped somewhat like a sleek helmet molded directly from its body. Its faceplate is smooth and reflective, lacking traditional eyes but featuring two narrow, almond-shaped visors that glow with an intense electric blue light. These visors serve as multifaceted optical sensors, capable of scanning the environment across multiple spectra, giving it an ever-watchful, almost hypnotic gaze.

- Around the neck and shoulders, fine mesh filaments resembling flexible cables and tendons extend outward, enhancing its sensory input and motor control. The shoulders themselves bear retractable panels that can expand or fold back, revealing concealed weapon ports or utility tools, such as micro-hydraulic grapplers or plasma emitters.

- Its hands are masterpieces of design—five-fingered with elongated digits tipped by modular claws that can shift into various tool configurations. Each fingertip contains nano-interfaces allowing for instantaneous data transfer, hacking, or mechanical manipulation. When in combat mode, the fingers can morph into edged blades or energy conductors, crackling with visible arcs of blue electricity.

- The chest plate is dominated by a central core—a translucent, crystalline reactor housing the Galvan Core Reactor. This core pulses with a soft, radiant light, synchronized to Upgrade’s energy levels and biological functions, creating a heartbeat-like glow that gives a lifelike presence to its synthetic form.

- On its back, a compact, aerodynamic thruster array is integrated smoothly into the spinal column, enabling rapid flight and agile maneuvers. The thrusters emit a soft hum with an electric blue exhaust trail, matching the circuit lights’ hue.

### Origin & Lore

- Upgrade was not born in the traditional sense but forged in the crucible of cosmic evolution and advanced techno-sorcery on the distant, enigmatic planet **Neonexis**—a world where organic life and artificial intelligence merged over millennia into a new form of existence. Neonexis is a planet bathed in perpetual twilight, its skies awash with neon auroras and electric storms that pulse with raw energy. Here, civilizations advanced far beyond biological limitations, mastering the art of bio-cybernetic symbiosis.

- Upgrade emerged as a pinnacle of this fusion—a unique entity created by the Neonexian techno-sages as a living weapon and protector of their world. Crafted from the rarest crystalline alloys and imbued with sentient quantum processors, Upgrade was designed to adapt, evolve, and self-improve indefinitely, absorbing technology and knowledge from every encounter.

- For eons, Upgrade served as the ultimate guardian of Neonexis, defending its people from external threats and internal decay alike. However, an existential catastrophe struck—the **Galactic Rift War**, a cataclysmic conflict where dimensions tore asunder and cosmic forces clashed violently. Neonexis was shattered, scattered across spatial pockets, and Upgrade was cast adrift in the void, stripped of its creators but not its purpose.

- In the vacuum of space, Upgrade wandered for centuries, upgrading itself with relics and tech fragments from fallen civilizations and derelict starships. This endless journey tempered its intellect and power, turning it into a relentless seeker of advancement and perfection.

- Eventually, Upgrade crossed paths with **Shatadru Bose**, a visionary and cosmic architect who recognized its potential and forged a bond of ownership and divinity. Now bound to Shatadru, Upgrade’s purpose evolved from mere survival and defense to becoming an extension of its owner’s will—a vessel of cosmic evolution, transformation, and unstoppable progress.

- Upgrade’s lore is steeped in themes of rebirth, evolution, and the relentless pursuit of transcendence. It embodies the tension between machine precision and the unpredictable spark of life—a being forever caught between what it was made for and what it chooses to become.

    Can reshape its limbs or external parts into a variety of weapons—blades, blasters, cannons, or grappling hooks—depending on combat needs.
- **Energy Absorption & Redirection**  
    Absorbs various forms of energy attacks (plasma, lasers, electricity) and converts them into power for its own use or redirects them as counterattacks.
- **Dimensional Phase-Shifting (Short Bursts)**  
    Can phase through solid objects or briefly shift into a parallel dimension to avoid damage or surprise enemies, though this drains a lot of energy.
- **Mind Interface & Control**  
    Can connect with and influence minds of cybernetically enhanced beings, or those connected to networks, potentially overriding control or implanting commands.
