Home Planet: Methanos / Himalayas (spiritually connected)
Owner: Shatadru Bose
Title: King of Swampfire, Omnitrix Sage, Guardian of Eternal Fire

---

### Appearance

Swampfire resembles Ben's original form, but with profound divine enhancements. His bark-like armor has evolved into hardened, jagged plating, radiating a bioluminescent blue and green glow from beneath. His eyes shine like twin suns, and veins of blue fire pulse across his body. His movements are agile yet heavy with ancient power. Behind him floats a mystic aura, shaped like a burning lotus with bear claws.

### Origin & Lore

Forged in the core of Methanos and reborn in the mythological fires of Earth's ancient past, Swampfire: Jambavan Reborn was created when Shatadru Bose unlocked a forgotten fusion in the Omnitrix—merging his core with the spirit of Jambavan, the divine bear king from the Ramayana. This wasn't a mere transformation—it was soul-deep symbiosis.

He was awakened during the Omnitrix’s deep-link event with the Time Matrix, granting him access to eternal divine memory, allowing him to tap into battles of past yugas. He now walks across galaxies not as a soldier, but as a cosmic sage-warrior, carrying the ancient wrath of fire and wisdom of the gods.
