- - The **X Barrier** is a unique **two-layered cosmic shield** over Alien X’s chest and brain:
    - The **outer layer** is the **Time Barrier**, protecting the Forge of Creation by preventing paradoxes, temporal disruptions, and timeline tampering.
    - The **inner layer** is the **Celestialsapien Reality Barrier**, a fundamental shield that preserves the core reality of the Celestialsapiens and maintains the integrity of cosmic laws inside Alien X.
- These two barriers together form the **X Barrier**, an impenetrable cosmic defense system that guards the most sacred realms of creation and existence.

### Weaknesses & Limitations

- **Council Deliberation Delay:** Decisions requiring full court consensus can take time, leaving openings in critical moments.
- **Vulnerability to Paradoxical Entities:** Certain abstract cosmic beings or paradox forces can bypass the Time Barrier’s defenses.
